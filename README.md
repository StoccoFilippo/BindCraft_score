# BindCraft Scoring

This script evaluates the parameters used for loss and filtering in the [BindCraft paper](https://github.com/martinpacesa/BindCraft). 

## Usage

1. Clone **ProteinMPNN** inside the `functions` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN functions/ProteinMPNN
   ```
2. Set up the **BindCraft** Conda environment as described in the `bindcraft` folder.
3. Provide as input:
      a . **FASTA file**
      b . **AlphaFold3 (AF3) results** in a directory (see example of inputs). Note that the binder should be "B", while the target should be "A"
      c . PDB of the target without any binder

### Output:
The script generates a **CSV file** containing all scoring parameters.
